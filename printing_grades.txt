Design a solution algorithm that will read a file of student test results 
and produce a student test grades report. 
Each test record contains the student number, name and test score (out of 50). 
The program is to calculate for each student the test score as a percentage 
and to print the student’s number, name, test score (out of 50) 
and letter grade on the report.

The letter grade is determined as follows:
A = 90–100%
B = 80–89%
C = 70–79%
D = 60–69%
F = 0–59%

INPUTS
student_number
student_name
test_score_out_of_50

PROCESSING STEPS/ALGORITHM
Print Student Test Grades Report heading
Read student test grades report
Divide test_score_out_of_50 by 50 to get test_score_as_percentage for each student
Compare percentage to select letter grade for each student

OUTPUTS
Student Test Grades Report heading
student_number
student_name
test_score_out_of_50
letter_grade

PSEUDOCODE
Print_Student_Test_Grades_Report
Print "Student Test Grades Report" heading
    Read student test grades record
	DOWHILE morerecords exist
		Calculate test_score_as_percentage = (test_score_out_of_50 / 50) * 100
		IF test_score_as_percentage >= 90 AND test_score_as_percentage <= 100
			Set letter_grade to A
		ELSE IF test_score_as_percentage >= 80 AND test_score_as_percentage <= 89

		ELSE IF test_score_as_percentage >= 70 AND test_score_as_percentage <= 79

			Set letter_grade to D
		ELSE IF test_score_as_percentage >= 0 AND test_score_as_percentage <= 59
			Set letter_grade to F
		ENDIF
	
        Print student_number, student_name, test_score_out_of_50, letter_grade
		Read student test grades record
