Design a solution algorithm that will read a file of student test results and produce a student test grades report. Each test record contains the student number, name and test score (out of 50). The program is to calculate for each student the test score as a percentage and to print the student’s number, name, test score (out of 50) and letter grade on the report.
The letter grade is determined as follows:
A = 90–100%
B = 80–89%
C = 70–79%
D = 60–69%
F = 0–59%

INPUTS
student_number
student_name
test_score_out_of_50

PROCESSING STEPS
Print Student Test Grades Report heading
Read student test grades report
Divide test_score_out_of_50 by 50 to get test_score_as_percentage
Compare percentage to select letter grade

OUTPUTS
Student Test Grades Report heading
student_number
student_name
test_score_out_of_50
letter_grade
